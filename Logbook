Day Zero
15th December
Learned Blender for an hour using trial and error method. 
Shading:
        Created an image texture. And applied it to a "face" and "eyes" and animated the whole lot using keyframe animation. 
The video is here. "The first wink" will be there in my projects folder. It's only 400 kB in size. That's surprising.

This has been 13th December. 
I have to publish a paper soon and it's kinda secretive. I'll update here after I start working on it. 
Good day.
