Day Zero
15th December
Learned Blender for an hour using trial and error method. 
Shading:
        Created an image texture. And applied it to a "face" and "eyes" and animated the whole lot using keyframe animation. 
The video is here. "The first wink" will be there in my projects folder. It's only 400 kB in size. That's surprising.

This has been 13th December. 
I have to publish a paper soon and it's kinda secretive. I'll update here after I start working on it. 
Good day.

Day One
Made a pumpkin in blender. It was a professionally disappointing day. I tried to map the path of a camera onto a bezier curve but I didn't complete it. 
ROSCON, apparently, is happening in bangalore and a friend of mine is attending the event. I want to be there but I didn't even know it was happening. 
NOTE TO SELF: Be a bit more Aware. 
I have formed a solid concept of what my research paper is going to be about. I'll start the documentation today. I am not sure if I can publish it without extensive research or/and a mentor's support, but we'll see I guess.

Day Two
No updates
I learned a bit of blender, and wasted a few hours in war thunder.
I have everything I need, except for the motivation. Looks like I too am stuck in this trap. I have to work on the research paper at least.

16th December
Day Three
It is already 17th December. I sarted learning python formally on 16th, wrote a program, in which I imported datetime and obtained current minute, and checked if it was odd or even, using a odd ={odd numbers manually typed from 0 to 60}
Ran it, and I was surprised to see how easy python was. Imagine doing the same in C. :'(
I love C but it might be time I moved on to python because I have rarely used it outside of the classes I take during my free time. I am no longer confident in taking classes as I can hardly write a error free data structure code in C without the help of chatGPT. 
Lazy, I have become. 
Will try to do more tomorrow (Today)
